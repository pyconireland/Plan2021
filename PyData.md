Plans for PyData Activities
=====================================

#### Virtual Meetups in Summer/Autumn 2020


#### PyData Component in PyCon Ireland 2020

* PyCon Ireland is due to take place in early November 2020.
* There is a high probabity of cancellation of the live event for those dates, and as such, PyCon Ireland will probably be a virtual event.
* No decision has been taken on what PyData activities will be part of PyCon Ireland 2020.

#### Regional PyData Events in Spring 2021

* Potential for hosting workshops in Limerick, Cork and Galway
* The workshops will take on Saturday Morning between 10am anf 4pm approx
